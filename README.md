# channelserver
This project is a micro-service for exposing multiple release channels for a software project. It is inspired by (and follows the convention of) GitHubâ€™s `/releases/latest` paradigm, which will always redirect to the latest release of a project.

It expands on the `/releases/latest` concept by allowing you to create multiple release channels, each with their own URL that will redirect to the latest release for that channel.

A channel's latest release can be configured by [explicitly pinning it to a version](https://github.com/rancher/channelserver/blob/439813cefa7a0bd048052bcabc7b1c6ad796e97a/channels.yaml#L4) or by [selecting a set of releases via regular expression](https://github.com/rancher/channelserver/blob/439813cefa7a0bd048052bcabc7b1c6ad796e97a/channels.yaml#L11) (in which case the most recently release matching the regex will be resolved as the latest release). For more examples, see the [sample config](https://github.com/rancher/channelserver/blob/master/channels.yaml).

The primary usecase for this project is currently Rancher's [system-upgrade-controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller), which is used for automating upgrades of k3s and k3os. In the system-upgrade-controller, a user can specify a channel exposed by this sevice as the URL in the plan.spec.channel field.

This service is in production for k3s here: https://update.k3s.io/v1-release/channels, which is driven by this config: https://github.com/rancher/k3s/blob/master/channel.yaml. Each channel's `self` link is the URL that will resolve to the latest GitHub release page for that channel.

## Compile and Run 
1. build the binary
```
go build . 
```
2. run the server
```
 ./channelserver --config-key k3s --path-prefix v1-release --channel-server-version v2.3.1
```

3. run the following curl command or open the url in the browser
```
curl 0.0.0.0:8080/v1-release/release 
curl 0.0.0.0:8080/v1-release/channel 
curl 0.0.0.0:8080/v1-release/appdefault
